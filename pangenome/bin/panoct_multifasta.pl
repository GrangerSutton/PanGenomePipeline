  Usage: $prog <options>
Example: panoct_multifasta.pl -b output_dir -P multifasta_input_file -M matchtable_file -C cluster_ids_files
Version: $version
 Option:
     -h: print this help page
     -b: base directory path for where to put output multifasta files[DEFAULT = PWD]
     -P: multifasta input file of all genes input to PanOCT (can be peptide or nucleotide)
     -M: matchtable input file
     -C: cluster identifiers input file (this should usually be numbers)
     -D: DEBUG MODE (DEFAULT = off)
 Output: All stored within a directory specified using -b
          1) cluster_id.fasta:  a multifasta file containing the sequences in the specified cluster

panoct_multifasta.pl requires several input files to specify the gene sequences, cluster identifiers, and clusters.

The input files are:

A multifasta file containing all of the gene sequences input to PanOCT (peptide or nucleotide) using the same gene identifiers as
were used for PanOCT for instance the peptide file specified to PanOCT using -P. The file is specified by the -P option.

A file of cluster identifiers. The file is specified by the -C option. The cluster identifiers must be placed one per line in the
file with nothing else on the line. The cluster identifiers must be the same as in the first column of the matchtable - default for
PanOCT is to number the clusters from 1-N.

A matchtable produced by PanOCT with the first column being a cluster identifier and subsequent columns being gene identifiers or a
placeholder indicating no gene for that genome

The output files are multifasta files, one per cluster identifier specified, containing the gene sequences for the cluster.
